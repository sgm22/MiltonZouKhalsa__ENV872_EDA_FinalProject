# MiltonZouKhalsa__ENV872_EDA_FinalProject

This repository serves as space to develop the final class project required by ENV872 (Environmental Data Analytics) at Duke University.

## Summary

This repository acts as a hub for the project group members to store data and remain coordinated as each member contributes to the goals set forth for the project.  It contains multiple data folders holding processed, raw, and spatial data.  It is also home to the project RMD file containing the bulk of the code written to process our data.  We are using COVID-19 data from 2020 to 2022 collected from the U.S. Census Bureau and the New York Department of Health. Additionally, we are using the state map file that was incorporated in class for ENV872.  The repository also contains the Rproj project file, gitignore file, license file, and this readme file.

We plan on answering the central question: how well does the population of a county correlate with the occurrence of COVID-19 in New York State?  We will do this by examining three relationships.  First, we will measure the strength of the relationship between different settlement types and cumulative COVID-19 cases.  Second, we will determine the association between population density and the number of COVID-19 tests conducted.  Third, we will answer the question: is there a difference between the relationship between the absolute population and settlement type and the relationship between the population density and settlement type?
